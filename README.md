CherryTree Phone – Bringing CherryTree to Android

May 2025

For several years, I’ve been using CherryTree, a free and open-source note-taking software for desktop. It’s an incredibly practical tool for organizing notes in a tree structure, making information easy to manage and navigate.

However, no equivalent application existed for mobile devices — so I decided to develop my own version from scratch.

🧠 Project Overview

CherryTree Phone is an Android adaptation of the original CherryTree app, designed to allow users to import and view CherryTree (.ctb) files directly on their phones.

The project was built using:

HTML and JavaScript for the user interface

Android Studio for app integration and packaging

AI assistance for development optimization

A mix of curiosity, persistence, and creativity

⚙️ Key Features

Import and open .ctb files created on the desktop version of CherryTree

View notes in a hierarchical structure

Simple and clean interface optimized for mobile screens

Runs natively as an APK on Android devices

🚀 Development Insights

The most challenging part of the development process was configuring all required files in Android Studio to ensure proper interaction between the HTML/JS front-end and the Android system.

After many iterations and hours of debugging, the app finally came to life — successfully bringing the CherryTree experience to Android for the first time.
